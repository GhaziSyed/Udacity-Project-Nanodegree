# STEDI Human Balance Analytics Udacity Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for the STEDI Human Balance Analytics project, which is part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program.

## Project Overview

The STEDI Human Balance Analytics project focuses on analyzing human balance data using STEDI (Spatiotemporal Dynamic Imaging) technology. The goal is to develop insights and predictive models to understand and improve human balance performance. In first step, as a data engineer on the STEDI Step Trainer team, the goal is to extract the data produced by the STEDI Step Trainer sensors and the mobile app, and curate them into a data lakehouse solution on AWS so that Data Scientists can train the learning model.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
